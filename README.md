# Welcome to my React Dictionary!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What does it do?

Enter any English word that you know, and you'll be able to see:

### Pronunciations

Never seen this word before? Not entirely sure how to pronounce it? 
Say goodbye to the embarrassment of pronouncing a word incorrectly during an important meeting, conversation or presentation - this dictionary can teach you exactly how to say the word you need. 

### Definitions

Find out what the word means. Is it a Noun? A Verb? What about an Adjective? 
This dictionary will tell you that, too!

### Synonyms

Sometimes, the word you have just doesn't fit the text you're writing. 
This dictionary will suggest different terms that mean the same thing as the word you searched. 

### Images

Ok, so you have a definition and synonyms, but what if you just want to *visualise* the meaning?
Check out the bottom section to find multiple, free-to-use images related to your search term available online.

This dictionary was created as my capstone project for the 'React' course run by SheCodes.
